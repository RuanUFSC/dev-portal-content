title: "Cancel Order"
slug: "cancelorder"
excerpt: "You should use this endpoint to cancel an order by its order identification number (the `orderId`).\n\nA common scenario is one where the seller has a problem with the order fulfillment and needs to request the order cancellation to the marketplace. To do this, the seller would need to make this request, passing the `orderId` in the URL.\n\nThere should be no body in this request.\n\nYou should expect a response with the date when the notification was received, the orderId, and a receipt protocol code.\n\nBe aware that if the order status is already `Invoiced`, the order can only be canceled if—before using this request—you send a return invoice through the [Order Invoice Notification endpoint](https://developers.vtex.com/reference/invoice#invoicenotification)."
