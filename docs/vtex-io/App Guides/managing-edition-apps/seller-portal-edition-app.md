The [Seller Portal](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/seller-portal-primeiros-passos--6w1vBdRH2uuBGmUqgNQjwK) is a VTEX platform edition used by sellers to connect and sell their products on VTEX marketplaces. What differentiates it from a regular VTEX Admin is the curation of pages: we have selected only the key pages from VTEX’s Admin that fit the most with a seller’s operations.

That selection is possible because Seller Portal is actually a VTEX IO app. All pages available on the Seller Portal are declared in an Edition App, built using VTEX IO. This means that all sellers added to the marketplace’s Seller Portal, will see the same experience, which is defined in the edition app.

In this guide, we will go over some key concepts around the Edition App’s architecture and point out how marketplaces can configure their own Edition App, to create a customized Seller Portal.
