Version 3.x of VTEXâ€™s Google Tag Manager (GTM) allows stores to send events in the GA4 format while still sending UA events, facilitating a smooth transition to GA4.  To migrate to the app's 3.x version, please follow these steps:

1. Refer to the Create a [Create a Google Analytics 4 property](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-installing-google-tag-manager#create-a-google-analytics-4-property) section and follow the instructions provided.
2. Once you have completed the setup, proceed to the  [Setting up Google Tag Manager documentation](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-setting-up-google-tag-manager) documentation for instructions on configuring events, tags, and triggers specifically for GA4.

By following these steps, you'll be able to smoothly migrate to the latest version of the app and set up events, tags, and triggers for both GA4 and UA formats.
