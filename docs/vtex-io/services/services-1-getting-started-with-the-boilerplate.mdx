The first thing you need to do is clone the [service-course-template](https://github.com/vtex-trainings/service-course-template) boilerplate, which is a template repository that we provide with all the initial files that you need to get started in this course.

Follow the [step-by-step](#step-by-step) instructions to get started with the boilerplate and its dependencies.

## Step-by-step

Follow these instructions to clone both repositories and link the app to your workspace.

1. Clone the boilerplate by running the following command:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/vtex-trainings/service-course-template
    ```
    
2. Read the [Boilerplate overview](#boilerplate-overview) section to understand the files in the template.
    

## Boilerplate overview

The [service-course-template](https://github.com/vtex-trainings/service-course-template) boilerplate contains two directories (`/node` and `/graphql`) and the `manifest.json` file, which is an important file to your VTEX IO app because it will be the first communication point with VTEX IO. Check the following sections for information on each of them.

### Understanding the manifest.json file

<CH.Scrollycoding>

In the `manifest.json` file, you will find the app's information, such as name, vendor, version, and other fields. For now, in this initial state, it is important to understand builders, policies and dependencies:

| Field | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
|`builders` | Object | Defines which builders your app will need. In this case, we currently only have the `node` builder, with its respective version. |
| `policies` | Array | If the app being built needs to access some external services or get some specific data from other places, it needs to declare these policies in this array, even for external APIs. At this point, we have no specific policies yet. |
|`dependencies` | Object | Other VTEX IO apps your app depends on. Note that the [service-course-template](https://github.com/vtex-trainings/service-course-template) app has a dependency on the [events-example](https://github.com/vtex-apps/events-example) app. The [events-example](https://github.com/vtex-apps/events-example) app, when linked to your account and workspace, is responsible for providing events examples. In the next step, you will clone it as well.  |

```json service-course-template/manifest.json focus=7:9,14:17
{
  "name": "backend-course",
  "vendor": "vtex",
  "version": "0.0.2",
  "title": "Backend Course",
  "description": "Reference app for the Backend Course",
  "builders": {
    "node": "6.x"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "prereleasy": "bash lint.sh"
  },
  "credentialType": "absolute",
  "policies": [],
  "dependencies": {
    "vtex.events-example": "0.x"
  },
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtex/node-vtex-api/master/gen/manifest.schema"
}
```

### Understanding the `/node` directory

All directories used during this course are already in this initial project. Most of the directories are empty and will be filled throughout the course. Check the table below to understand the folders and files you will use:

| Folder or file | Description |
| - | - |
| `/node/clients` | Both files are almost blank and are now just placeholders for the next steps. |
| `/node/handlers` | Contains a handler that will be used in the next steps. |
| `/node/utils` | You will find a file containing global constants declarations (`/node/constants.ts`). |
| `/node/index.ts` | Contains the initial declarations for the app functionality like the cache declaration and the service declarations, which will be incremented during the course. Here it is also possible to export resolver functions implementations (for GraphQL). |
| `/node/service.json` | Describes your REST API and some characteristics that will directly impact your app's infrastructure attributes. Read the [next section](#understanding-the-service-json-file) for more details. |

### Understanding the `service.json` file

<CH.Scrollycoding>

Your `service.json` file will be found inside your app's `/node` folder. Check the table below to understand the information available in this file:

| Field | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `memory` | Integer | How much memory in megabytes your app will have allocated. This value will be overwritten if IO detects that your app is abusing memory usage. |
| `timeout` | Integer | VTEX IO infra will abort the connection if the request time is longer than this timeout, defined in seconds. |
| `minReplicas` | Integer | Determines how many minimum replicas will be available when your app is running. |
| `maxReplicas` | Integer | The largest amount of replicas that will be available. |
| `routes` | Object | Describes your app's REST routes, inside which you will describe the name, (ex: `ssr`), the path, and inform if it's public or private. |

  ```json service-course-template/node/service.json
  {
  "memory": 256,
  "timeout": 2,
  "minReplicas": 2,
  "maxReplicas": 4,
  "routes": {
    "status": {
      "path": "/_v/status/:code",
      "public": true
    }
  }
  ```

### Understanding the `/graphql` directory

On this directory, you will find only the empty directories and the `/graphql/schema.graphql` blank file. This will all be filled throughout the course as well.
