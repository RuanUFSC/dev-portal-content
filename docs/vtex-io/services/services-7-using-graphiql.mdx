With the query and resolver implemented, we need to use it to retrieve the top N most viewed products. By using the **GraphQL IDE**, we can test the query we implemented before.

[GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) is a graphical interactive in-browser GraphQL IDE. Before using the query in the app, let's test its functionality. To do so, we will reproduce your query usage in the GraphQL IDE.


## Step-by-step

To test your query, follow the steps below:

1. Access the GraphQL route you received in the previous step. 

   Exploring the IDE interface, there are three main areas: the coding area, the query variables area and the debug area. Check where each shows up in the interface in the image below.

2. Add the code below in the coding area:

```graphql GraphQL query
query ($topN: Int) {
 productList(topN: $topN){
   slug
   count
 }
}
```

---

3. The query that we just declared uses a variable (`topN`). Now we need to declare it in the _Query Variables_ area.

   > The _Query Variables_ area is below the coding area, to amplify its area just drag by the title.

```json Query variables
{
 "topN": 2
}
```

4. At last, just click on the _Play_ button and check the outcome on the debug area. The query results should look like this:
