Every API in this reference gets its own category listed in the menu to the left. Endpoints are listed individually but grouped by function and get an icon to identify the request method (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) used.

## accountName & environment
You can set the `accountName` variable to test requests with your own account or use the `apiexamples` test account. The `environment` variable can be set to either `vtexcommercestable` or `vtexcommercebeta`.
