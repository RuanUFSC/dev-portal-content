This app implements list-context interfaces that allow users in Site Editor to
add and remove content easily.

## Disclosure List Context

Diclosure layouts allow users to toggle information visibility by clicking a
trigger. For example, it is used in FAQs to allow the user to hide or show a
question's answer. Previously, to add a FAQ item it had to be added directly to
the store theme code. With a list context, the admin user can add and remove FAQ
items directly via site editor.
