The VTEX ProductLead Embed app is a first party integration to the [ProductLead solution](https://productlead.me).

ProductLead wants to increase engagement and time on VTEX shops with shoppable content, linking the story with the point of sale. And we want to do this with:
-- Low-code/no-code integration;
-- VTEX native integration;
-- Fast experimentation;

This app allows you to easily integrate the Shoppable Galleries from Productlead. Once youâ€™ve connected ProductLead to VTEX, the account will be synched. All future Shoppable Galleries created in ProductLead will show up in the dedicated section of the VTEX app, ready to be linked and used on your website.

Usage:

- Connect Shoppable Galleries from ProductLead inside of VTEX
- Choose which Shoppable Galleries to show on your VTEX website and where to show them (Product Detail Page, Product Category Pages, or on any other pages/section inside of VTEX)
