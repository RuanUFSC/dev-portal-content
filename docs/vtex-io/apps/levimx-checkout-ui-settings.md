The Checkout UI Settings app is responsible for **customizing your store's Checkout UI through scripts**.

The main advantage of using the app instead of the [store's admin](https://help.vtex.com/tutorial/configure-template-in-smartcheckout-update--ToTE5XB39t0SwtHgpgwSv?locale=en) for this customization is that your Checkout scripts will behave as configurations for platform apps.

In practice, it means that Checkout UI Settings allows A/B testing in your store's scripts, in addition to the possibility of quick rollbacks for old scripts (i.e. scripts pertaining to older Checkout UI Settings app's versions).

Also this application allows to show the Cross Selling or a product collection.

## Configuration

1.  Using your terminal and the [VTEX IO Toolbelt](https://vtex.io/docs/recipes/development/vtex-io-cli-installment-and-command-reference), log into the desired account;
2.  In the `manifest.json` file, change the predefined default value `vendor` to the name of the account in which you want to install the app;
3.  Run the `npm run dev` command and keeping it running to copy any change to route /checkout-ui-custom, that you working in the files in /src.;
4.  Run `vtex link` to syncs the app in the current directory with the development workspace in use.;
5.  When you are done making changes, you must run the `npm run build` command to obfuscate the source code. Now you can publish the app;

## Remember üö®

Just you must <mark>work</mark> files like in /src and not in /checkout-ui-custom;

| `responsive`     | `object`  | Object containing breakpoints and settings objects (see demo). Enables settings sets at given screen width.

### Example:

```json
 responsive: [
      {
        breakpoint: 980,
        settings: { slidesToShow: 4, slidesToScroll: 4 },
      },
      {
        breakpoint: 750,
        settings: { slidesToShow: 2.5, centerMode: true, arrows: false, swipeToSlide: true },
      },
      {
        breakpoint: 550,
        settings: { slidesToShow: 1.5, centerMode: true, arrows: false, swipeToSlide: true },
      },
  ]
```

## Modus Operandi

Once the app is deployed and installed in the account, every scripts contained in it will be automatically linked to your store and used to [build the templates](https://help.vtex.com/tutorial/configure-template-in-smartcheckout-update--ToTE5XB39t0SwtHgpgwSv?locale=en#configuring-templates-from-the-code-menu) to customize your Checkout.

:warning: **Scripts used by Checkout are linked to the Checkout UI Settings version that's installed in your store**. If a prior app version was already installed and your want to change the scripts linked to it, you'll need to repeat the already existing code and thereafter launch the app's new version containing the changes you just did. Housekeeper is responsible for updating app versions in the accounts it's installed in.
