Select your app and start **writing**, **simulating** and **testing requests** to validate your GraphQL API using `GraphiQL` (a graphical interactive in-browser GraphQL IDE).

  To install this app, just go to your VTEX IO workspace and run:
  
  ```
  vtex install vtex.admin-graphql-ide
  ```

  As soon as the app is installed the button `GraphQL IDE` will already appear in the section "Store Setup" of your `admin` menu (left side of your screen in the admin page). 
  
  The URL path is `<your-website>/admin/graphql-ide`. Have fun!

  > Obs: The `vtex install` command above will install the latest version of `Admin GraphQL IDE`, that is compatible with vtex.admin@3.x. If you need to keep using `vtex.admin@2.x` in your workspace and cannot upgrade it to `vtex.admin@3.x`, you can run `vtex install vtex.admin-graphql-ide@2.x` that is compatible with this prior `admin` major version.
