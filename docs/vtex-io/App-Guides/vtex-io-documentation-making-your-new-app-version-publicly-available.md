To make your new app version available to end users, follow the steps below.

1. [**Release** your app](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-releasing-a-new-app-version): Create a release commit and a release tag.
2. [**Publish** a candidate version](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-publishing-an-app): Turn the app version into a candidate version by generating an internal build for **testing purposes only**.
3. [**Validate** the candidate version in a **production workspace**](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-publishing-an-app): Check for critical issues that may have gone undetected during development.
4. [**Deploy** the app as a stable version](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-deploying-the-app-stable-version): Update the app version on all accounts that have the app installed.
5. [Promote your changes to **Master**](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-promoting-a-workspace-to-master): Make the new app version available to end users.
