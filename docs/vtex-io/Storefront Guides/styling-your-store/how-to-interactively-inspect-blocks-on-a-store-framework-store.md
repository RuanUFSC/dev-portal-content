## Prerequisites

You can only use this method on a **development workspace**.

## How to

1. Access `https://{workspace}--{account}.myvtex.com/path-you-want/?__inspect`. 
2. You'll be able to inspect each React element and grab information about the block.
3. You can see the VTEX IO app that exports this block, the block itself and block class.
