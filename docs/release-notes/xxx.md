The `hasListPrice` prop was added to the `product-selling-price` block from [Product Price app](https://vtex.io/docs/components/all/vtex.product-price/), and it is responsible for defining whether the product should display its [list price](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/prices-v2--tutorials_4393?locale=en) (if any) or not. 

The new prop makes it possible to display a different text on a product selling price if any list price exists and differs from the first one.
