![Store Framework](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Store%20Framework-red)

Display products on your store's search results page according to the collection in which they were first sorted!

Yep, that's right: the `order-by` block, part of the Search Result app, now works with products' colletions (`OrderByCollection`). Do not forget to learn more about it in the [Search Result documentation](https://vtex.io/docs/components/all/vtex.search-result/)!
