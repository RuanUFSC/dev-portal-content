The Availability Notify app shows a subscription form when a product SKU is unavailable. The form lets customers subscribe to get notified when that item gets restocked.

The app records the notification request and monitors inventory updates. Once the requested SKU gets back in stock, the app emails the shoppers who asked to be notified.
To learn more about the app and implement it in your store, please refer to its [technical documentation](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-availability-notify).
