Invoices in Customer Credit can now be associated with a simpler identifier stored in the `friendlyId` field, containing eight alphanumeric characters and the installment number. For now the field can only be edited using the [Customer Credit API](https://developers.vtex.com/reference/customer-credit-api-overview), but it will be available in the Admin and in My Credits section soon.
