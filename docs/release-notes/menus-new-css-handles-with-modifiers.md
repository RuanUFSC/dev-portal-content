New CSS Handles with modifiers (`submenuWrapper--isOpen`  and `submenuWrapper--isClosed`) were added to the [Menu app](https://vtex.io/docs/components/all/vtex.menu/), making it possible to create animation effects when the submenu opens and closes according to the user navigation.

Notice how the menu animation showed above only works because the `submenuWrapper--isClosed` Handle is being applied.
