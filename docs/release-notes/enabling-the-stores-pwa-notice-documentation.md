The documentation for [Enabling the store's PWA notice](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/enabling-pwa-push-notifications-in-your-store--1be3ZPhbsgZSbE7h5H46pG?&utm_source=autocomplete) has been updated, and now it is available in [VTEX Help Center](https://help.vtex.com/).

Before, it was in the Storefront implementation guides of the Developer Portal. However, as it is a tutorial related to a setting in the Adminâ€™s CMS, we have added it to the Help Center's CMS track.
