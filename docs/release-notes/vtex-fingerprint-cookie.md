On June 8th, the VTEX Fingerprint cookie was deprecated in order to provide performance improvements in VTEX's checkout experience.

VTEX Fingerprint is a cookie set by our store, and we identified that this cookie is not mandatory in any type of validation made internally by VTEX. 

Considering it was hurting sales from customers who use Firefox as a browser, we decided to remove `VtexFingerPrint` from checkout to increase the sales performance and avoid inconsistencies in the future.
