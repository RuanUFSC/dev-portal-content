A [homologation](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/docs/payments-integration-payment-provider-homologation) freeze is a precaution taken by VTEX before Black Friday to ensure our platform no longer performs any updates and becomes more resilient and reliable. During this period, we will be in security mode to avoid jeopardizing the stability of our customers' businesses.

## How is the freeze done?

We will have a deadline for receiving requests for approval and publication of payment connectors in our gateway. Therefore, tickets opened after the deadline will be queued for publishing and updating but will not be updated before Black Friday, November 25, 2022. After Cyber Monday week, our team will resume its regular schedule with periodic request updates.

## Homologation security schedule

The homologation freeze dates are:

- Deadline to receive tickets for homologation before Black Friday: October 11, 2022
- Deadline for homologation: November 18, 2022
- Normal homologation process resumes: December 6, 2022

## Additional information

The connector homologation commitment is valid only for official VTEX partners and valid for their specific operating regions.

If the homologation sent within the deadline needs to be changed or fixed by the partner, this adjustment must also be made respecting the limit of our freeze schedule presented above regarding **the homologation deadline** on November 18, 2022.
