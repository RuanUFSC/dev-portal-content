![Store Framework](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Store%20Framework-red)

A new CSS Handle (`swiperBullet--active`) was added to the [Product Images block](https://vtex.io/docs/components/all/vtex.store-components/productimages)(from the [Store Components app](https://vtex.io/docs/components/all/vtex.store-components/)), enabling the customization of the active slide dot.

This handle is extremely useful for scenarios where the Product Images block is used to build a slider component, such as a [Carousel](https://vtex.io/docs/recipes/templates/building-a-carousel-using-slider-layout).

:information-source: *The slider active dot represents the slide currently being hovered on by users.*
