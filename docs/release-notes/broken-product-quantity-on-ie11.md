Internet Explorer 11 is one of the browsers supported by the Store Framework, but it seems to me that the [Product Quantity](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/apps/vtex.product-quantity/) component didn't get that until now... silly component!

This disruptive behavior had been fixed and the component now works perfectly for IE11 users as well.
