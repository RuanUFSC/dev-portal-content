Internet Explorer 11 is one of the browsers supported by the Store Framework, but it seems to me that the [Product Quantity](https://vtex.io/docs/components/all/vtex.product-quantity/) component didn't get that until now... silly component!

This disruptive behavior had been fixed and the component now works perfectly for IE11 users as well.
