It ain't Christmas yet, but this one surely will make you feel gifted: a new improvement in the [`product-context`](https://github.com/vtex-apps/product-context)' types has enabled the auto-complete feature when declaring the desired app's properties.

In practice, your code editor from now on is able to tell you which properties are actually valid and which are not while you develop custom components using the Product Context, avoiding errors, and saving your precious time!
