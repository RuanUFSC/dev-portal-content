VTEX technology allows for flexibility, enabling our clients to build commerce experiences that address their needs and potentialize their strengths.

## What changed?

Now, we are making available a [Headless commerce integration guide](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/headless-commerce) that can help you leverage VTEX APIs to build a headless shopping experience considering that you:

- Will use VTEX core commerce features via REST APIs.
- Will use the native VTEX ID page to authenticate shoppers.
- Can build your storefront using a third-party Content Management System (CMS), instead of VTEX storefront solutions, except for the authentication page.
- Can use VTEX IO to host core commerce microservices and any developed applications to extend functionality.
