We have updated the API Reference of the Gift Card Hub. For the Settlement and Cancellation endpoints, the path parameter `transactionID` was changed to `tId`. The `transactionID` used in other endpoints is an ID generated by VTEX, while `tId` is an ID generated by the Gift Card provider. The endpoints with this change are:

- get [List All GiftCard Settlement Transactions](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/reference/listallgiftcardsettlementtransactions)
- post [Create GiftCard Settlement Transaction](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/reference/creategiftcardsettlementtransaction)
- get [List All GiftCard Cancellation Transactions](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/reference/listallgiftcardcancellationtransactions)
- post [Create GiftCard Cancellation Transaction](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/reference/creategiftcardcancellationtransaction)

Also, we added missing descriptions for the following parameters throughout the API:

- `giftCardProviderID`
- `giftCardID`
- `REST-Range`
- `transactionID`
- `tId`
