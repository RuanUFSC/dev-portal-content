Other VTEX Store Framework apps can now use the context exported by the [Seller Selector app](https://vtex.io/docs/components/all/vtex.seller-selector/) (`SellerContext`) regarding seller data:

```json
import { SellerContext } from 'vtex.seller-selector'
```

âœ¨ We would not be able to deliver this amazing result if it was not for [Beatriz Miranda](https://github.com/BeatrizMiranda) from ACCT! Our sincere thanks, Beatriz!
