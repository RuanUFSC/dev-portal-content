Now all the Kit Look block modules can be added or removed via the Admin, on the app's settings page.

Before that, Kit Look was a strict block in which you couldn't select which components you'd like to render.

We also added three new components:

- Product Description - Description of the products in the Kit Look.
- Quantity totalizer - Total number of items included in the Kit Look.
- Price totalizer - Price of all the products included in the Kit Look.

These changes do not affect production clients since the  components previously rendered by the Kit Look app are the ones selected by default on the app's settings page.
