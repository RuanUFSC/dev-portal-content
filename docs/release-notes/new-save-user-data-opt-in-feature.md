In compliance with regulations that promote the preservation and protection of consumer data, such as GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) in Europe, and LGPD (General Data Protection Law) in Brazil, VTEX provides the new [Save User Data opt-in](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/docs/enable-the-save-user-data-opt-in) feature.

This feature displays a checkbox on the Checkout screen for the user to decide if they want the store to keep their personal and payment details for future purchases.
