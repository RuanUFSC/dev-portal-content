Shopping experience was being harmed because of the unexpected extra time needed to redirect users to the Minicart once the `Add to cart` button was clicked on.

[Our wonderful team deployed a series of performance fixes and small improvements](https://github.com/vtex-apps/add-to-cart-button/pull/50), such as adding a native loading bar to the page, in order to enhance navigation during the shopping experience!
