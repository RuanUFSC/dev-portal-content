![Store Framework](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Store%20Framework-red)

Thanks to the two new props added to the `gallery` block from the [Search Results app](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-search-result), namely the`customSummaryInterval` and the `CustomSummary`,  it is now possible to build a custom product summary in your search result page.

Together, both props allow you to choose a block to be rendered in a specific product interval.

Notice how the search results page above has a flexible layout to show fetched products.
Do not forget to check out the [Search Results documentation](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-search-result) to read further about the props and learn how to set them up in your store!
