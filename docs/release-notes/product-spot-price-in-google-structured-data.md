![Store Framework](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Store%20Framework-red)

The product spot price is now considered in the  `lowPrice`  field from Google structured data, used to understand and gather information about the content of the store page.

This improvement is extremely useful for VTEX Store Framework stores who use Google Shopping, once the last one will now be able to effectively fetch the product lower price (meaning the product spot price).

In case no product spot price was configured, Google structured data will fetch the product selling price instead.

âœ¨ We would not be able to deliver this amazing result if it was not for [Matheus Araujo](https://github.com/MatheusR42) from Corebiz! Our sincere thanks, Matheus!
