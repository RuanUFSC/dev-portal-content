The SKU Selector had its product data frozen when rendered on slider components. In the previous and ugly scenario, users could only update the data displayed when scrolling the page or changing the slide currently being hovered on. 

Good thing is that we are close to the summer in Brazil and the SKU Selector was defrosted just in time: it is now [fixed](https://github.com/vtex-apps/slider-layout/pull/46) and working as expected!
