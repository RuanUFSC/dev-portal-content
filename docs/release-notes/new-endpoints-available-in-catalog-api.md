The [Catalog API](https://developers.vtex.com/reference/catalog-api-overview) is now more flexible with dozens of new endpoints. Actions previously restricted to the [Webservice](https://assets.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/4OdeCFbcVQtEgkuWsuuidl/80b79448cf2b327e07b567a8411afaa0/vtex_WebServiceGuide.pdf) (SOAP API) were incorporated to the REST API, so this is now the preferred method of communication with the Catalog for new integrations.
