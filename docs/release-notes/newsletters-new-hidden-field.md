The [Store Newsletter app](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-store-newsletter) has now a new block: the `newsletter-hidden-field`!

The block does not render any component on the interface but instead enables you to use hidden fields on the form to fetch custom data, such as the user binding, and save them in the store's [Master Data](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/what-is-master-data--4otjBnR27u4WUIciQsmkAw) whenever one subscribes to the store newsletter.
