![Store Framework](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Store%20Framework-red)

Let's give a warm welcome to the new [Store Media app](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-store-media), responsible for displaying image alongside video assets in your storefront.

  "body": "Previously, the Store Framework did not have a single app to handle both media formats (image and video). Users had to work separately with the [Store Image](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-store-image) and the [Store Video](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-store-video) apps."
