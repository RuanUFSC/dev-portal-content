![Store Framework](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Store%20Framework-red)

The `taxValue` variable was added to the `product-list-price` and `product-selling-price` blocks from [Product Price app](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-product-price), allowing you to display tax values instead of taxes percentage or display the value alongside the percentage.
