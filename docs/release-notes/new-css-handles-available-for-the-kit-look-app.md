New CSS handles have been added to the [Kit Look app](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtexbr-kitlook) in order to allow greater customization flexibility.

Previously, the styling options for the Kit Look app were limited.

Now, we have released new CSS handles that allow styling and customizing the Kit Look's size, title, add-to-cart button, and more.

The following CSS handles are now available:

- `kitlookBox`
- `kitlookButton`
- `kitlookCheckbox`
- `kitlookContainer`
- `kitlookDetails`
- `kitlookImage`
- `kitlookName`
- `kitlookPrice`

For further information on how to use CSS handles, please refer to the [Using CSS Handles for store customization](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-using-css-handles-for-store-customization) guide.
