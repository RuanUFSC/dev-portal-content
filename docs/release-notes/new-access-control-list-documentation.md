We created new documentation about **Access Control List**, a feature that allows you to create a list of users that can access specific products on the store. This feature can be integrated into the B2B ecommerce model.

Check our guide [Access Control List](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/access-control-list).
