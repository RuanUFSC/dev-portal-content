<div class="badge" id="VTEX-Payment-for-physical-stores"> VTEX Payment for Physical Stores</div>

The VTEX Payment for physical solutions integrates the VTEX Payment app to point of sales' payment devices. Frequently, our clients use inStore - VTEX Omnichannel solution - to operates this dynamic.  

However, some payment terminal connections instabilities happened during the buying act. For example, when a client tried to make a purchase, the VTEX Payment system couldn't pair up with the store's physical payment device.  

Thus, the client had to manage both apps to solve those errors. 

Now the VTEX Payment app handles all payment errors on one single function to solve this scenario. 

These are:

* Try Again
* Change Device
* Cancel Operation

All these commands communicate with the inStore solution and instruct the user which action has to be done to solve each issue.
