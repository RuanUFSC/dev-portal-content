The Slider Layout has gained a new prop called `centerMode` responsible for defining the slider elements positioning on the screen.

Thanks to it, stores can now display slides whose elements are centered, allowing users to see a peek of the previous and next slides while navigating on the store, as shown in the image below:

This improvement is extremely useful in Shelves and other components that use the Slider Layout for rendering product data.

For more details on the new prop, access the [Slider Layout documentation](https://vtex.io/docs/app/vtex.slider-layout).
