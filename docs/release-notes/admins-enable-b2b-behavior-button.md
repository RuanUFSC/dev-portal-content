Previously, a store interested in working as B2B environment should toggle the `Enable B2B behavior` button on the admin's VTEX Store section, among other steps described in our [technical documentation](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-configuring-a-b2b-environment).

The button has now been removed from the interface.

In practice, the B2B behavior is now automatically enabled in all VTEX stores when the platform authenticates a user browsing the store through a private trade policy.
