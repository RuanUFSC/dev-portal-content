![Store Framework](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/dev-portal-content/main/images/product-specifications-block-0.png)

The [Product Specification block](https://github.com/vtex-apps/store-components/blob/master/docs/ProductSpecifications.md), pertaining to the [Store Components app](https://vtex.io/docs/app/vtex.store-components/) was deprecated.

Although support for this block is still provided, it is strongly recommended to update your store theme with the [**Product Specifications app**](https://vtex.io/docs/components/all/vtex.product-specifications@1.0.1/) in order to benefit from greater flexibility and keep up with the component evolution.
