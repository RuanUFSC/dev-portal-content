It is now possible to add a link to the Product Highlight's string text thanks to the new `link` prop of the `product-highlight-text` block.

The link allows you to redirect users to a store page of your choice, such as the product collection.

To know further, do not forget to access the [Product Highlights app documentation](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-store-components-producthighlights)!

> ⚠️ The Product Highlights app was deprecated and replaced by the [Product Specifications app](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-product-specifications).

> ℹ️ This release was possible thanks to [proudynyu](https://github.com/proudynyu)! Cheers!
