It is now possible to define how your Serch Result's filter title will be rendered and analyzed by search mechanisms thanks to the new `filtersTitleHtmlTag`  prop added to the `filter-navigator.v3`  block (from the [Search Result app](https://vtex.io/docs/components/all/vtex.search-result/)).

The new prop allows you to choose the desired HTML tag for rendering the filter title. Previously, the element only accepted the `h5` tag.
