The `paymentMethods` field from the [Create Payment endpoint](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/reference/createpayment) in our Payment Provider Protocol API had its description updated. The new description describes better the function of the parameter and includes reference links to [List Payment Methods](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/reference/paymentmethods) and [List Payment Provider Manifest](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/reference/manifest-1) endpoints.
