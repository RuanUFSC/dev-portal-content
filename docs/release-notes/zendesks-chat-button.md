A new Zendesk's chat button was developed to lazy-load the default and heavier one provided by the solution. 

The replacement button, exported by the [Zendesk Chat pixel app](https://vtex.io/docs/components/all/vtex.zendesk-chat/), can add 15 and 30 points to your Lighthouse score for mobile and desktop devices, respectively. And it gets better: you can also customize the button on your account's admin page.
