![Documentation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/dev-portal-content/main/images/new-erp-integration-guide-is-now-available-0.png)

As a follow-up to our recently published [new Catalog API endpoints](https://developers.vtex.com/changelog/new-endpoints-available-in-catalog-api), we have published an updated [ERP integration guide](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/erp-integration-guide) detailing how to use our API endpoints to:

- Set up catalog
- Import products
- Import prices
- Import inventory
- Set up order integration
- Set up order processing
- Set up invoicing and tracking

This brand new documentation replaces our obsolete guide using the Webservice SOAP API and is now the recommended reference for ERP integration.
