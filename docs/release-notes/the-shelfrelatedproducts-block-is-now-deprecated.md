The `shelf.relatedProducts` block, exported by the [Shelf app](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-shelf), is now deprecated. The block will only stop receiving updates, but you can still use it.

The block is responsible for rendering a list of related products on the product details page.

> ℹ️ Despite the deprecation notice, support for the block is still granted.
