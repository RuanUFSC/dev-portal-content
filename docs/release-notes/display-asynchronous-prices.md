To display the most up-to-date prices without compromising the increase of your store's page response time, check out the recipe [Displaying asynchronous prices](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-displaying-asynchronous-prices).

The recipe guides you on setting your store up to decrease page response time with asynchronous prices by fetching product prices on the client-side, promoting a decrease of response time in your pages, and displaying the asynchronous prices.
