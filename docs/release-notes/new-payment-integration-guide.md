To make it easier for partners to integrate payment providers into VTEX, we have published an updated [Payments Integration Guide](doc:payment-provider-integration-guide). The new guide details how our [Payment Provider Protocol](doc:payment-provider-protocol) works and everything you need to know to perform an integration such as:

- [PCI - DSS Compliance](doc:pci-dss-compliance) certification
- [Payment methods](doc:payment-methods) and [purchase flows](doc:purchase-flows)
- API endpoints needed to [implement a payment provider](doc:implementing-a-payment-provider)
- Payment provider [homologation](doc:payment-provider-homologation) process
