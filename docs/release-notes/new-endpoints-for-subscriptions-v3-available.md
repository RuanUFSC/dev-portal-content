Subscriptions v3 has just been launched and along with it, a new [section](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/reference/subscriptions-api-v3-overview) in our API Reference with endpoints regarding Cycles, Plans, Reports and Subscriptions.

Subscriptions v3 introduces a new understanding of what subscriptions are and makes Subscriptions v2 deprecated. More information can be found in the [Subscriptions v3 Migration Guide](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/subscriptions-v3-migration-guide).
