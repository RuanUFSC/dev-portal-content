![Commerce APIs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/dev-portal-content/main/images/new-endpoints-on-marketplace-api-0.png)

We added two new endpoints to the Marketplace APIs:

- [Notify marketplace of inventory updates](https://developers.vtex.com/reference/notification#inventorynotification)
- [Notify marketplace of price updates](https://developers.vtex.com/reference/notification#pricenotification)
These endpoints are used by sellers to notify marketplaces that the price or inventory level has changed for one of their SKUs. External sellers can optimize their operations with VTEX marketplaces using specific endpoints for each type of update.
