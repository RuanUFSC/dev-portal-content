![Store Framework](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/dev-portal-content/main/images/product-specifications-app-0.png)

Aiming to bring you more flexibility when using the Product Specifications component, our product team developed the Product Specifications app, replacing the former [Product Specifications block](https://github.com/vtex-apps/store-components/blob/master/docs/ProductSpecifications.md) exported by the [Store Components app](https://vtex.io/docs/app/vtex.store-components).

The set up is just a few clicks away from you: check out now the new [Product Specifications app documentation](https://vtex.io/docs/components/all/vtex.product-specifications/)!
