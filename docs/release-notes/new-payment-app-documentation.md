We created new documentation for **Payment App**, a feature that allows for one of our three types of [purchase flow](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/docs/payments-integration-purchase-flows). You can use it to develop your own app on VTEX IO for personalized payment experiences in [payment integrations](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/docs/payments-integration-implementing-a-payment-provider). This app makes a UI element (a window) appear in the payment step of the checkout, like the one below.

The main scenarios of usage for this feature are to implement the frontend of the payment or to include a verification step in the payment (i.e: authentication with [3DS 2.0](http://3dsecure2.com)). The Payment App also offers an advantage since you donâ€™t need to redirect the user to another webpage.
