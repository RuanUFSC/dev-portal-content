Create a CSS global file specifically for your store's fonts and change your store's typography according to your business needs using your store theme code.

> ⚠️ The `font-faces.css` file is now mandatory when changing your store's typography using your store theme code meaning uploading fonts directly in the app's CSS overriding files will no longer work.

For more on this topic, access the [Customizing your store's typography](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-customizing-your-stores-typography/) documentation.
