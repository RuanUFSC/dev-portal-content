![Store Framework](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Store%20Framework-red)

Create a CSS global file specifically for your store's fonts and change your store's typography according to your business needs using your store theme code.

> ⚠️ The `font-faces.css` file is now mandatory when changing your store's typography using your store theme code meaning uploading fonts directly in the app's CSS overriding files will no longer work.
