Previously, you had only two choices: create one coupon with only one coupon code or generate a massive number of coupons with similar coupon codes. This [new endpoint](https://developers.vtex.com/reference/coupons#post_api-rnb-pvt-multiple-coupons) now allows you to generate multiple coupons with different coupon codes. It also permits you to create a custom number of coupons with the same coupon code.
