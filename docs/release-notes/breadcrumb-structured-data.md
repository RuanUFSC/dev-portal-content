Previously, neither the [Breadcrumb app](https://vtex.io/docs/components/all/vtex.breadcrumb/) or the store itself provided the `position` and `itemListElement` data necessary to guide search engines to the current page position in the store category tree.

With this release, the Breadcrumb app is now configured to have [structured data](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/intro-structured-data), improving our SEO.
