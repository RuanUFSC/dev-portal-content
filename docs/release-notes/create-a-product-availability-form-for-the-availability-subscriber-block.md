Before configuring the [Availability Subscriber block](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-store-components-availabilitysubscriber), to show the availability subscriber form when a product is unavailable, you must configure a JSON schema in Master Data.

For that to happen, learn how to set up this form by checking the [Creating a product availability documentation](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-creating-a-product-availability-form).

>⚠️ This configuration does not include sending automatic e-mails to users. The product availability form only stores the user data filled out to the store's Master Data entity.
