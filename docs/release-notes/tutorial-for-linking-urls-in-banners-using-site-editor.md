The documentation for [Linking URLs in banners using Site Editor](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/linking-urls-to-banners-using-the-site-editor--4z2PagtN733waiWA8ttOuD) has been updated and now it is available in [VTEX Help Center](https://help.vtex.com/). 

Before, it was in the Storefront implementation guides of the Developer Portal. However, as it is a tutorial related to a setting in the Adminâ€™s Site Editor, we have added it in the Site Editor track of Help Center.
