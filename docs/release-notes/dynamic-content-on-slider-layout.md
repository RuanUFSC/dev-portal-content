The Slider Layout has gained full support for dynamic content!

Previously, the component couldn't behave as expected with a dynamic number of slides i.e. when slides were added and removed according to user interaction (as in the case of product-comparison components). The Slider Layout is now adapted to always work as it is configured, regardless of its new content.
