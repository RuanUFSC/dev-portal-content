To facilitate your onboarding with VTEX, we have created new 'Getting Started' guides for developers. They serve as a map of existing content in our Developer Portal, directing you to the main developer journeys in VTEX's Catalog, Orders, Promotions and Pricing features.

- [Orders](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/docs/orders-overview)
- [Catalog](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/docs/catalog-overview)
- [Pricing](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/docs/pricing-overview)
- [Promotions](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/docs/promotions-overview)

ðŸ“£  âœ¨ **We need your help to improve this content, based on your feedback!**

Once you access any of these guides, a satisfaction survey will appear on your screen. Fill in the fields to share your experience with us! Rating our docs takes less than 60 seconds, we promise!
