Thanks to the new `openFiltersMode` prop it is now possible to define how many filters can be opened by a user at the same time on the Filter Navigator component.

Notice that only one filter can be opened at one time. In the example above, the prop `openFiltersMode` is declared as `one`.

For more details, access the [Search Result app documentation](https://vtex.io/docs/components/all/vtex.search-result/).
