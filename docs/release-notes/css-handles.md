New CSS Handles were added to the [Product Specifications block](https://github.com/vtex-apps/store-components/blob/master/docs/ProductSpecifications.md), exported by the [Store Components app](https://vtex.io/docs/app/vtex.store-components/), in order to grant you more flexibility while customizing the component's elements. 

Namely, they are: `specificationsTableRow`, `specificationsTableHead`, and `specificationsTableBody` .
