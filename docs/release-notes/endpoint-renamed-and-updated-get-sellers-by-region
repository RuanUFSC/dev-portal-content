The "Get sellers by region" endpoint has been renamed to "Get sellers by region and address". From now on, in addition to the `regionId` path parameter, you can use three query parameters (`country`, `postal Code` and `geo Coordinates`) to get a list of White label sellers in your store serving a given delivery region or address.
