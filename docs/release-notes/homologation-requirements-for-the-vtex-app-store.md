We have added the documentation [Homologation requirements for the VTEX App Store](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-homologation-requirements-for-vtex-app-store). Following the guidelines described on it, you guarantee a baseline standard of quality, viability, and usability for the app available for VTEX stores and succeed in the homologation process.

In addition, we also updated the [Submitting your app in the VTEX app store](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-submitting-your-app-in-the-vtex-app-store) documentation to reflect those homologation requirements.
