![Store Framework](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/dev-portal-content/main/images/error-message-for-store-forms-schema-0.png)

Error messages were added to the Store Form app in order to warn developers whenever the JSON schema was invalid, i.e. built with an inaccurate structure!

What more can I say? It is safe to claim that the dog days are (*almost*) over for VTEX IO developers!
