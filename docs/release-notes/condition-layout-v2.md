![Store Framework](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vtexdocs/dev-portal-content/main/images/condition-layout-v2-0.png)

The Condition Layout as we know was remodeled in order to achieve a clearer logic when setting the conditions to build your store's layout.

In addition to its new [documentation](https://vtex.io/docs/components/all/vtex.condition-layout/), do not forget to access the [migration guide](https://github.com/vtex-apps/condition-layout/blob/master/docs/MIGRATION-GUIDE.md), specially prepared to help you with this upgrade!
