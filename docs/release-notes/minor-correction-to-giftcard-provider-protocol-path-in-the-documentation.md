Some GiftCard Provider Protocol endpoints had an `/api` segment in their paths. This was corrected, and the `/api` segment was removed from the documentation. The affected endpoints are:

- [List All GiftCards](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/reference/listallgiftcards)
- [Get GiftCard by ID](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/reference/getgiftcardbyid-1)
- [Create GiftCard](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/reference/getgiftcardbyid-1)
