You can now schedule a timeline in [Customer Credit API](https://developers.vtex.com/reference/customer-credit-api-overview) for pre-payment and post-payment e-mail notifications. Up to three triggers can be set for each timeline using the `notificationsSettings` field of the [\[PUT\] Create or change store configuration](https://developers.vtex.com/reference/store-configuration#createorchangestoreconfiguration) endpoint.

For now the field can only be edited using the [Customer Credit API](https://developers.vtex.com/reference/customer-credit-api-overview), but it will be available shortly in the Admin panel.
