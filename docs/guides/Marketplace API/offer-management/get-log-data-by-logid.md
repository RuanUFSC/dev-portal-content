slug: "get-log-data-by-logid"
excerpt: "In [Offer Management](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/docs/sent-offers-integration-guide-connectors), logs are the granular details of actions that happen within an [interaction](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/reference/open-interaction), organized in a timeline. All interaction's micro-steps will be represented through logs; they are how interactions become visible in Offer Management UI. \n\nA unique code called `logId` is used to identify every log created. This endpoint enables the retrieval of information about a log by searching through its `logId`."
