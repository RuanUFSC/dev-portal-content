excerpt: "In [Offer Management](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/docs/sent-offers-integration-guide-connectors), VTEX platform and marketplaces interact with offers through a medium called [interaction](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/reference/open-interaction). \n\nOnce an interaction has fulfilled its initial goal and there are no more actions (or [logs](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/reference/create-log)) taking place within it, this endpoint closes an interaction."
