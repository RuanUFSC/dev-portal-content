excerpt: "In [Offer Management](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/docs/sent-offers-integration-guide-connectors), a feed is a list of information about seller's offers sent to a marketplace, and it is updated in real-time with content provided by the marketplace and VTEX modules. \n\nSince a seller can have integrations with multiple marketplaces, numerous feeds can be associated with an account. This endpoint retrieves a list with all the feeds related to an account."
