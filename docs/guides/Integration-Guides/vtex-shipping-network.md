Whenever a store has a package that needs shipping, it must first notify the designated carrier with the packageâ€™s information. Then, after dispatch, the carrier should send tracking information updates to the store until the delivery is complete.

To better perform these tasks, [VTEX Shipping Network](https://vtex.com/br-pt/log/) is a product that provides notification and tracking hubs with which carriers can integrate by developing applications in VTEX IO.
