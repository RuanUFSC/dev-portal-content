Product variations occur when an item has different attributes such as color and size. These variants are grouped together on a single product page.

On the Amazon marketplace, they are referred to as parent and child relationships. The parent is the actual product, and the children are the variants. For example, with a cotton shirt as the parent, the child could be a blue cotton shirt, a small cotton shirt, or a small blue cotton shirt, if multiple variants apply.

If configured correctly, product variations can improve the customer experience and increase sales. They can enhance visibility, especially for colors or sizes that may get lost among other search results. Customers may find a color or size they didnâ€™t realize existed in the range.

When dealing with colors as product variations, there are often specific requirements to consider, such as:

- A specific URL for each color.
- A specific product page and unique content for a specific color.
- Landing pages with products with the same colors.
- The ability to share only some colors and not all product variations with external services or marketplaces such as Google Shopping.

To meet these needs, we suggest using color as a Similar Product, rather than a SKU specification.

This approach allows you to create unique URLs and pages for each color, helping with SEO, and improving the customer experience. By following these tips, you can optimize your product color variation strategy, increase sales, and improve visibility.
