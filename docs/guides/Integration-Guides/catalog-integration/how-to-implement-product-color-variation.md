Product variations occur when an item that has different attributes, such as color and size, is grouped together with its variants on a single product page.

On the Amazon marketplace, they are also referred to as parent and child relationships. The parent is the actual product, and the children are the variants. For example, with a cotton shirt as the parent, the child could be a blue cotton shirt, a small cotton shirt, or a small blue cotton shirt (if multiple variants apply).

Not only do variations improve the customer experience, if done correctly, they can increase sales, as well. Product variations help items get greater visibility, since some colors or sizes may have been lost down the Amazon ‘black hole’ on the 30th page of the search results. By appearing on the same product page with colors and sizes that are ranking high in search, these SKUs get more visibility. In addition, customers might find a color or size that they didn’t realize existed in the range.

Usually, when we have colors as  product's variation potentially we can have some special necessities like:

- Specific URL for each color.
- Specific product page and unique content for a specific color.
- Landing pages with products with the same colors.
- To share just some colors and not all product's variations with external services like marketplaces like Google Shopping.

To accomplish that, we suggest not using color as SKU Specification but as a Similar Product.
