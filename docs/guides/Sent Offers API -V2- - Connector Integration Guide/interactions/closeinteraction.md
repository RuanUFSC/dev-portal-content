excerpt: "This endpoint closes an interaction, once there are no more actions (or logs) taking place within it, and it's initial goal is fulfilled. Interactions are the medium where VTEX and marketplaces interact about a specific event. They are how both agents inform Sent Offers about any changes made in an offer, in price, inventory, catalog information or status, for example. For every action that happens to the offer, the connector must create an Interaction notifying it, or update an existing one."
