>ℹ️ Check the new [Payments onboarding guide](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/docs/payments-overview). We created this guide to improve the onboarding experience for developers at VTEX. It assembles all documentation on our Developer Portal about Payments and is organized by focusing on the developer's journey.

The Gift Card is a payment method configured as a cash value associated to a client. It is used to grant a discount on the value of the order at the store.
