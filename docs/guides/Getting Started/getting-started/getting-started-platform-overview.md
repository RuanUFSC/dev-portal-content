Our core commerce capabilities, provided by over 70 shared microservices, are available for flexible customization through our <a href="https://developers.vtex.com/docs/getting-started-platform-overview#section-list-of-rest-apis" target="_blank">REST APIs</a>.

}
[/block]
In global commerce, scalability is a must for serious businesses: down-time means money left on the table. With cloud-based platform you can scale your business and forget the servers, leveraging our fully managed, auto-scalable infrastructure to keep orders coming even when customer demand reaches an all-time high. In Black Friday 2019, for instance, over <a href="https://vtex.com/us-en/one-million-orders/" target="_blank">1 million orders</a> were placed in VTEX stores in a single day. All of them went through without a hiccup.

No need to take our word for it - see what <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/retail/partner-solutions/?partner-solutions-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.partnerName&partner-solutions-cards.sort-order=asc&partner-solutions-cards.q=vtex&partner-solutions-cards.q_operator=AND#Find_AWS_Retail_Competency_Partners" target="_blank">Amazon</a> has to say about us. The **AWS Retail Competency Partners** undergo rigorous validation by AWS to ensure alignment to AWS best practices for building secure, high-performing, resilient and efficient cloud infrastructure for industry applications – to give customers an increased confidence when making decisions.
