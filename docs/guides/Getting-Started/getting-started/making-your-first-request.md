You can use the `TEST METHOD` button in [VTEX API reference](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference) to test API requests as you read the documentaion. In this tutorial you will learn how to use this feature.

## Trying out a simple GET

>‚ö†Ô∏è The example below is based on the [List orders endpoint](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/orders-api#get-/api/oms/pvt/orders), but these instructions apply for any endpoint you wish to try. Feel free to follow along.

To try out an API request follow these steps:

1. Head to the API reference page of the endpoint you wish to test, such as the [List orders endpoint](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/orders-api#get-/api/oms/pvt/orders).

![List orders page](./making-your-first-request-1)

Check out the following example, where we use the **Try It** feature in the API Reference of these Developer Docs to try a GET Category request. The `{{appKey}}` and `{{appToken}}` in the image should be replaced by your own appKey and appToken.

See below the expected response in our `apiexamples` store:

If you get a `401 - Unauthorized` as response, review the authentication steps. Make sure that the right permissions are defined in the roles and that you copied the exact appKey and appToken values into the headers of the request.

If you received a `200 OK` response, congratulations on your first successful request to VTEX APIs! üéâ

## Using Postman

Our API reference documentation is built using the [Open API 3.0 (OAS 3.0)](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md) standard. The OAS 3.0 schemas are available for [download](https://github.com/vtex/openapi-schemas) in our GitHub repository.

You can import our API endpoints to [Postman](https://www.postman.com/product/api-client/) by downloading the JSON schemas you are interested in and following [these instructions](https://learning.postman.com/docs/postman/collections/working-with-openAPI).
