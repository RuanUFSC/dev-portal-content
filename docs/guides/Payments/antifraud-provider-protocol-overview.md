It assembles all documentation on our Developer Portal about Payments and is organized by focusing on the developer's journey.

The Antifraud Provider Protocol is a set of definitions to help you integrate your antifraud service API into VTEX platform.

To achieve this, you need to implement a web API (REST) following the specifications described in this documentation.
