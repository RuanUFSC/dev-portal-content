A coupon is a code that when entered in the cart grants the customer a discount on the price of purchase for a determined product.

To make a coupon available for use you need to associate the coupon to a **Promotion**.

A single coupon can be associated with one or more promotions by filling the `utmSource` or `utmCampain` fields with the same values for both coupon and promotion configuration.

[block:callout]
{
  "type": "warning",
  "body": "Coupons cannot be deleted, only archived. It is important to emphasize that you can only archive one coupon at a time. You can edit and reuse a coupon, but the `coupon code` can not be modified.",
  "title": ""
}
[/block]

## Restrictions

Thereâ€™s a quantity limit to the active coupons. We recommend reusing coupons because a high number of coupons can compromise the Promotions & Taxes performance.

## How to create a coupon

You can create one coupon or multiple coupons at a time.

- To create a single coupon, use the <span class="api pg-type type-post">post</span> [Create coupon](ref:post_api-rnb-pvt-coupon) endpoint.
- If you want to create multiple coupons use the <span class="api pg-type type-post">post</span> [Create multiple coupons](ref:post_api-rnb-pvt-multiple-coupons) endpoint.

[block:callout]
{
  "type": "danger",
  "body": "If you try to create a coupon with an existing `coupon code`, the API will update the existing coupon."
}
[/block]

## How to edit a coupon

Coupons can be edited and reused as you wish. However, the `coupon code` cannot be modified.
[block:callout]
{
  "type": "info",
  "body": "There is a limited quantity of active coupons. Coupon reuse is highly recommended since a high number of coupons may compromise the Promotions & Taxes performance."
}
[/block]

## How to archive a coupon

As said before, you can only archive one coupon at a time. You must use the <span class="api pg-type type-post">post</span> [Archive coupon by coupon code](ref:archivebycouponcode) endpoint to do so.

## Examples of usage

### Creating 50 coupons

To create 50 different coupons with `coupon codes` randomly generated, you must use the [Create multiple coupons](ref:post_api-rnb-pvt-multiple-coupons) endpoint with `quantity` set to `50`.

If you want to define the `coupon codes`, you can use this route as well, setting the `coupon codes` params with the desired values and `quantity` as `1` for each `coupon configuration`, as the example below.
[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "[\n    {\n        \"quantity\": 1,\n        \"couponConfiguration\": {\n            \"utmSource\": \"cupom1\",\n            \"utmCampaign\": null,\n            \"couponCode\": \"test1\",\n            \"isArchived\": false,\n            \"maxItemsPerClient\": 10,\n            \"expirationIntervalPerUse\": \"00:00:00\"\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"quantity\": 1,\n        \"couponConfiguration\": {\n            \"utmSource\": \"cupom2\",\n            \"utmCampaign\": null,\n            \"couponCode\": \"test2\",\n            \"isArchived\": false,\n            \"maxItemsPerClient\": 5,\n            \"expirationIntervalPerUse\": \"00:10:00\"\n        }\n    }\n]",
      "language": "json"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
You can associate these 50 coupons to a single promotion by repeating the same `utmSource` or `utmCampaign` in all of them, and then linking that UTM tag to the promotion. This can be done for any number of coupons.

To create or update a promotion, check the <span class="api pg-type type-post">post</span> [Create Or Update Promotion](ref:createorupdatecalculatorconfiguration) endpoint.

### Creating single-use coupon and promotion

Sandy is a frequent client of your store and it is her birthday. You can use the [Create coupon](ref:post_api-rnb-pvt-coupon) endpoint with the `coupon code` set to `Birthday123`, associate it to a promotion then, send it to her.

To enable the single-use of a coupon, you must restrict the promotion to a single-use as well so she use the `Birthday123` code on her checkout for only one purchase. To do so, follow the steps bellow:

1. In the Admin, select the **Promotions & Taxes** module.
2. Click on **Promotions**.
3. Click on the **New Promotion** > **Regular** button.
4. Check the selection box of `utm_source` and add the `Birthday123` code to the field.
   ![cupom-Birthday123](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/vtexdocs/dev-portal-content@readme-docs/docs/guides/Promotions/6341488-cupom-Birthday123_85.png)
5. Uncheck the unlimited selection boxes from the **How many times will your promotion be applied in your store** and **How many times will your promotion be applied in your store per client fields**.
6. Add the number one to each field to enable the single-use promotion.
   ![restricao-promo-single](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/vtexdocs/dev-portal-content@readme-docs/docs/guides/Promotions/0b2666e-restricao-promo-single_88.png)
7. Click on **Save**.

### Coupon massive generation

To create a large number of coupons with the same settings, you can use the [Coupon Massive Generation](ref:massivegeneration) endpoint. This endpoint will generate the determined quantity of coupons differing only their names through automatic generation.

First, set the query param `quantity` to `10`, for example. Then, make the following request body:
[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "{\n  \"utmSource\": \"cupom\",\n  \"utmCampaign\": null,\n  \"couponCode\": \"ctest\",\n  \"isArchived\": false,\n  \"maxItemsPerClient\": 1,\n  \"expirationIntervalPerUse\": \"00:00:00\"\n}",
      "language": "json"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
The result for the request will be the creation of ten coupons with the same settings and the following response body:
[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "[\n    \"ctest-wzcp5lwt7yz1s7n\",\n    \"ctest-rb6smoassp2xe71\",\n    \"ctest-vpw84ag9tfi8khv\",\n    \"ctest-ne26wgmidp5ctht\",\n    \"ctest-127ng0ox09tho5l\",\n    \"ctest-qsowch8c8s7jipo\",\n    \"ctest-6acbsst6zpss75l\",\n    \"ctest-0bksc2tzh5ai946\",\n    \"ctest-4jjx8u2rrqj4ck9\",\n    \"ctest-hxiox1isdp6padl\"\n]",
      "language": "json"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
