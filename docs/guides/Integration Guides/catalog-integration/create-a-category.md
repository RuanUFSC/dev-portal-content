Categories organize your product assortment within your ecommerce. They work as hierarchical levels of product classification, making your clientâ€™s search for a product easier and keeping your store organized. 

Creating a category is the most basic configuration you must do in Catalog. For a product to exist, it must have a category associated with it. 

To create a category, one can use the [Create category](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/reference/catalog-api-post-category) endpoint. See the request body example below of the creation of a category called Clothing:

**Request body**

```json
{
    "Name": "Clothing",
    "FatherCategoryId": null,
    "Title": "Clothing",
    "Description": "Shop from brands like Patagonia, The North Face, Billabong, Columbia, and more to dress yourself for success.",
    "Keywords": "Clothing,apparel,clothes, clothing department",
    "IsActive": true,
    "ShowInStoreFront": true,
    "ShowBrandFilter": true,
    "ActiveStoreFrontLink": true,
    "GlobalCategoryId": 772,
    "StockKeepingUnitSelectionMode": "SPECIFICATION",
    "Score": null
}
```

**Response body**

```json
{
    "Id": 2000089,
    "Name": "Clothing",
    "FatherCategoryId": null,
    "Title": null,
    "Description": "Shop from brands like Patagonia, The North Face, Billabong, Columbia, and more to dress yourself for success.",
    "Keywords": "Clothing,apparel,clothes, clothing department",
    "IsActive": true,
    "ShowInStoreFront": true,
    "ShowBrandFilter": true,
    "ActiveStoreFrontLink": true,
    "GlobalCategoryId": 772,
    "StockKeepingUnitSelectionMode": "SPECIFICATION",
    "Score": null,
    "LinkId": null,
    "HasChildren": false
}
```

In this example, the created category is a parent category, which means that it is not inside another category. A *parent category* can have subcategories, or *children categories*, associated with it. To create a subcategory, you must insert the parent category ID on the `"FatherCategoryId"`.
