title: "Send SKU Suggestion"
slug: "savesuggestion"
excerpt: "This request is used by the seller when it wants to suggest that one of their SKUs is sold in the marketplace.\n\nBefore using this request, the seller should always use the [Change Notification](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/reference/catalog-api-get-seller-sku-notification) request in order to check if the SKU already exists in the marketplace. If it doesn't, then this is the next call in the SKU integration flow.\n\nIn the Send Suggestion request, the seller must send information about the SKU, such as the product and SKU name, the seller ID, and the image URL. All parameters are explained below."
