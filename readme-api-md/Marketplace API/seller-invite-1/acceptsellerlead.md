title: "Accept Seller Lead"
slug: "acceptsellerlead"
excerpt: "This endpoint is triggered by the seller onboarding wizard, once the seller confirms their invitation. It can be used by marketplace operators to manually accept seller leads, and carry on with their onboarding process. \n\nNote that there's no specific API call that allows status changes. The operations only allow the seller lead to move forward: \n\n From `invite` > to `Accept` > closing on `Create Seller`.  \n\nIf you want to change the status, you can start the process again, by deleting that lead through the *Delete Seller Lead* endpoint, and resending the invite through the *Resend Seller Lead's Invite* endpoint."
