slug: "saveautoapproveforaccount"
excerpt: "This endpoint enables the autoapprove rule to a marketplace's whole Received SKUs module. Once enabling the rule, received SKUs will be automatically approved on your store, regardless of the seller. For the autoapprove rule to work as expected, the approval [Matcher score](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/entendendo-a-pontuacao-do-vtex-matcher--tutorials_424) should be set up as 80 (default value), but you can configure a different number through the field `Score` in [Save Account's Approval Settings](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/reference/saveaccountconfig)."
