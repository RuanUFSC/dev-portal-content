excerpt: "In [Offer Management](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/docs/sent-offers-integration-guide-connectors), VTEX platform and marketplaces interact with offers through a medium called Interaction. For every action that happens to an offer, whether it is a status notification or a price update, the connector creates an Interaction about it. \n\nThis endpoint creates a new interaction for an SKU so that changes can be applied to an offer. The changes informed by interactions are related to: price, inventory, catalog and status. \n\nUsually, interactions process a single type of change at a time, but it is possible to add data about catalog, price, and inventory simultaneously in the same interaction."
