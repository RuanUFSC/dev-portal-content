title: "Deactivate Feed"
slug: "deactivate-feed"
excerpt: "In [Offer Management](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/docs/sent-offers-integration-guide-connectors), a feed is a list of information about seller's offers sent to a marketplace. After [creating a feed](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/reference/create-feed), it will be activated; and through this endpoint the seller can deactivate the feed. \n\nWhen a feed is deactivated, all data related to the marketplace is removed from Offer Management UI. That includes the channels, offers, interactions, and errors. \n\nDeactivating a feed does not mean deleting information, and the seller can restore the data by [activating the feed](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/reference/create-feed) again."
