slug: "search-errors"
excerpt: "This endpoint provides the single source of truth of updated error codes in [Offer Management's](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/docs/sent-offers-integration-guide-connectors) configuration. It retrieves a list of all the error codes available at that moment. \n\nThe connector will retrieve all the error codes available directly on this API and use the codes that apply the most to their error scenarios. Then, the connector will implement these codes into every validation error inside their system. \n\nThis endpoint allows filtering errors by using the following query params: `channel`, `brand`, `category`, `errorCategory`. It also counts with the following pagination query params: `sort`, `from`, `to`, `q`."
