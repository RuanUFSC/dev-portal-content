slug: "send-category-mapping-to-vtex-mapper"
excerpt: "Mapping categories guarantees that the VTEX category tree has a correct association with the marketplaceâ€™s category tree. \n\nTo perform this association, VTEX made VTEX Mapper available. It is a tool integrated to the VTEX platform that allows the user to relate categories created in VTEX to categories from the marketplace. \n\nThis endpoint allows connectors to send the marketplace's category tree mapped in the integration. \n\nConnectors should send the payload compacted in .gzip format. \n\nFor a detailed explanation of the steps required to develop a custom connector to become an external marketplace for VTEX sellers, check out our complete [External Marketplace Integration Guide](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/docs/external-marketplace-integration-guide)."
