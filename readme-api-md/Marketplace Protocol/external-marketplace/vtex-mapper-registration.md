excerpt: "Mapping categories guarantees that the VTEX category tree has a correct association with the marketplaceâ€™s category tree. \n\nTo perform this association, VTEX made VTEX Mapper available. It is a tool integrated to the VTEX platform that allows the user to relate categories created in VTEX to categories from the marketplace. \n\nThis endpoint allows connectors to register the external marketplace integration in VTEX Mapper. \n\nIn case VTEX Mapper detects an error and the call fails, the connector should check if mandatory information was sent correctly. Ex. are URLs correctly registered in the properties categoryTreeEndPoint and mappingEndPoint? \n\nFor a detailed explanation of the steps required to develop a custom connector to become an external marketplace for VTEX sellers, check out our complete [External Marketplace Integration Guide](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/docs/external-marketplace-integration-guide)."
