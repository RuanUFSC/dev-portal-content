excerpt: "Creates fulfillment order, meaning that it is an order for the seller's side in a sale made through a marketplace. This order assumes the transaction itself has already happened on the marketplace's side and, therfore, cares only about the fulfillment side.\n\r\n\r> If you plan to integrate external orders with possible [Price divergence](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/price-divergence-rule--6RlFLhD1rIRRshl83KnCjW#) be mindful of the `isCreatedAsync` request body field. \n\nFor a detailed explanation of the steps required to develop a custom connector to become an external marketplace for VTEX sellers, check out our complete [External Marketplace Integration Guide](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/docs/external-marketplace-integration-guide)."
