excerpt: "The seller is responsible for suggesting new SKUs to be sold in the VTEX marketplace and also for informing the marketplace about changes in their SKUs that already exist in the marketplace. Both actions start with a catalog notification, which is made by this request.\n\nWith this notification, the seller is telling the marketplace that something has changed about a specific SKU, like price or inventory, or that this is a new SKU that the seller would like to offer to the marketplace.\n\nThe body of the request should be empty.\r\n\r\n > â„¹ This path is an updated version of `/api/catalog_system/pvt/skuseller/changenotification/{skuId}`."
