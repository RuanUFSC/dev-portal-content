Authorization hold (also card authorization, preauthorization, or preauth) is the practice that holding this balance as unavailable until either the merchant clears the transaction, also called settlement, or the hold "falls off."

This operation does not appear in statements but the available balance will be updated.

The result of this operation is generate a preauthorizationId to use in settlement.
