excerpt: "> ⚠️ Check out the updated version of the SKU Seller endpoints in our [SKU Bindings API documentation](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-rest-api/reference/getbyskuid). If you are doing this integration for the first time, we recommend that you follow the updated documentation.\n\nThe seller is responsible for suggesting new SKUs to be sold in the VTEX marketplace and also for informing the marketplace about changes in their SKUs that already exist in the marketplace. Both actions start with a catalog notification, which is made by this request.\n\nWith this notification, the seller is telling the marketplace that something has changed about a specific SKU, like price or inventory, or that this is a new SKU that the seller would like to offer to the marketplace.\n\nThe body of the request should be empty.\r\n## Example\r\n\r\nLet's say your seller has the ID `123` in the marketplace and you want to inform the marketplace that has been a change in the SKU with ID `700`.\r\n\r\nIn this case, you would have to replace the `sellerId` parameter with the value `123` and the `skuId` parameter with the value `700`. The URL of the request would be the following.\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttps://{{accountName}}.vtexcommercestable.com.br/api/catalog_system/pvt/skuseller/changenotification/123/700\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Response codes\r\n\r\nThe following response codes are possible for this request.\r\n\r\n* 404: the SKU was not found in the marketplace. The body of the response, in this case, should follow this format: \"Seller StockKeepingUnit `{{skuId}}` not found for this seller id `{{sellerId}}`\". This means that the seller can now proceed with sending an offer to the marketplace in order to suggest that this SKU is sold there.\r\n* 200: the SKU whose ID was informed in the URL already exists in the marketplace and was found. The marketplace can now proceed with a fulfillment simulation in order to get updated information about this SKU's inventory and price.\r\n* 429 - Failure due to too many requests.\r\n* 403 - Failure in the authentication."
