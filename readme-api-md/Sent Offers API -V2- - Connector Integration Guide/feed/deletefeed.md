title: "Deactivate Feed"
slug: "deletefeed"
excerpt: "The integration starts with the creation of the Feed. Use this endpoint only if a connection between seller and channel must be deactivated. If you wish to reactivate this Feed, you must repeat the process of activating the feed. When a feed is deactivated, all data related to that channel disappears for the Sent Offers user. The channel, offers, interactions, and errors will no longer be seen in the UI, but is not completely lost. Sent Offers' system still stores the interactions history. So if the feed is reactivated, the information will be shown once again."
