title: "Create Log"
slug: "createlog"
excerpt: "Logs are the granular details of actions that happen within an interaction, organized in a timeline. They are the way an interaction is made visible in Sent Offerâ€™s UI. All micro steps that go through an interaction will be represented through logs. This endpoint adds logs that take place within an interaction. To add logs in a specific interaction, the connector must take the `interactionId` created previously, through the Open  Interaction endpoint. \n\n`Errors`: When Sent Offers, or the connectors, find an error that prevents sending or updating an offer to a channel, they should open a type `failure` log, and fill in its details through the `errors` attribute. From the information sent through this attribute, sellers can identify and fix errors on their offers. Connectors must identify all errors, and send them all in a single request. This means that connectors should go through every possible validation, and only after all errors are identified, create the failure log."
