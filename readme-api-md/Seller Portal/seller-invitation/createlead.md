excerpt: "This API is used by marketplace operators to invite sellers to join the Seller Portal. The request sends an email to the seller, inviting sellers to activate their store on Seller Portal. The invitation's link in the email is unique per user, and available for only seven days for the seller to click and begin activating their store on Seller Portal. \n\n The e-mail template is completely customizable. All e-mail templates that Seller Portal sends to seller leads can be found and edited in the marketplace's Admin, on the Message Center tab."
