  "body": "We have unified our VTEX Tracking APIs into a single version, so it's no longer necessary to specify the version on the URL. We have also translated all paths to english. Check out our [changelog ](https://developers.vtex.com/updates/release-notes/vtex-tracking-api-changes-in-all-paths) to know more about the changes.\n\nThe previous paths were not deprecated, and are still being maintained by the VTEX Tracking team. If your business' integration was built with the previous v1 and v1.1 endpoints, it will still run smoothly. No changes in your integrations should be done during the Black Friday period. We will communicate any updates, and deprecations of endpoints in the future.",
