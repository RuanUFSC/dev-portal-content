  "body": "- We recommend that customers call our GET endpoints only once in every 6 hours. \n- We do **not** recommend, and consider as a bad practice, to retrieve data from the same endpoint more than once during a 6-hour window. This represents a major load to our API that will slow down the overall usage of our systems.",
